I took Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 course and I don’t regret a single second.
For those of you that don’t know Wes Bos offers a free course where you build 30 small projects in 30 days.
You can do them in 20 if you like (like I did), since the videos are all there and available for free.

### What I learned ###

You learn a lot by just watching Wes write out the code. But you learn so much more by just writing the code along with him.

*“When to use let and const”* one of the really important lessons you see here is when to use the
ES6 features of const and let. Const for values that don’t really change or at all and let for
the values that do change or you want to assign values to later on.

*“Using console.log, console.table and console.dataset to debug”* seems really trivial to use console.log to check if your
function is working.. well… it wasn’t to me. I don’t know why I never used it this way, but now I do!
Also console.table is great for much better looking logs and console.dataset for much more detailed views of objects and their properties.

*“Get the element, write a function, add the function with an even listener”* was one of the best things about the course.
Wes shows you new things and does them in a similar way throughout the entire series. He gets the HTML element, store it
into a const variable, writes the function that has to do the thing he wants and glues the function to the event listener,
usually a keyboard click or mouse click. Really simple recipe that you don’t see taught anywhere else and is in my opinion
the stepping stone to getting anything done with JS.

*“Exposed to video, image, animation, canvas and more”* I’ve never worked with video prior to this course, coding your own
HTML5 player was so interesting and fun. The video where you can paint with your mouse on the canvas, again, really fun.
You will be exposed to a lot of stuff that is skipped over a lot with courses.

*“ECMAScript 6 Galore”* Wes is a power user of ES6. Template strings, let, const, arrow functions and more.
A lot of tutorials are outdated, not even showing you ES6 features or just mentioning them quickly, while it’s already
common practice to use these features in production even without transpilers and polyphills. Big thumbs up here.

There you go, a quick post about JS30 and why you should take it :)
