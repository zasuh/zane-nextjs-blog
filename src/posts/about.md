## Hello ##

### Me in 10 seconds ###
Front end developer with a liking for React, CSS-in-JS and TypeScript. Also love movies, games, an assortment of metal music subgenres and of course my girlfriend 💙

### Me in 10 minutes or more ###
### Development
Started learning how to write code in late 2014 as I was "finding" myself and what I want to do with my life. HTML, CSS and JS were my first choices and are still the corner stones of what I develop in today. I have since started learning and implementing more TypeScript and Node into my knowledge with various JS and CSS frameworks, libraries and tools along the way. Below you can see a full list along with my current skill level (as of December 2019).

 - **HTML** : *Proficient* - Personally have no issues with it.
 - **CSS** : *Amateur/Proficient* - And will probably stay this way since CSS is bottomless.
 - **JS** : *Amateur/Proficient* - Fluent in it, but like with CSS it's a constant learning challenge to understand it.
 - **TS**: *Mildly Exposed* - Only just getting into it, but I understand it enough where I can use it in smaller scale projects.
 - **Node**: *Midly Exposed* - As with TS I'm still getting more and more acquainted with the environment and ecosystem.
 - **GraphQL/Apollo Client**: *Beginner* - I like GQL and the Apollo Client since I was exposed to them in GatsbyJS and will continue to learn them and make smaller projects to solidify that knowledge.
 - **Rust**: *Want to learn*
 - **C++**: *Want to learn*
 - **Databases**: *Want to learn* - This is broad, but generally I want to learn just enough so I can understand what is going on with databases and how APIs are made to retrieve data from the backend.

- **React**: *Proficient* - My preffered UI framework for web development.
- **Vue**: *Amateur* - Built a couple of very small projects with it just to get a feel. I like it and would use it again.
- **Angular**: *Mildly Exposed* - Built one ToDo app with it and found it to be too complex for smaller projects. Would definetly pick it up if given the chance.
- **Gatsby**: *Amateur* -  Personal site is built with it along with a few other projects. Like it, but need more learning to really understand some of the opinionated designs.
- **Styled Components**: *Amateur/Proficient* - Currently my favourite way to do styling in React projects. The problem with CSS remains tho.
- **Bootstrap**: *Amateur/Proficient* - Used it as a core CSS framework and as a one of the many iterations for various framework e.g. reactstrap and ng-bootstrap.
- **Svelte**: *Want to learn*
- **Tailwind**: *Want to learn*
- **Next**: *Want to learn*
- **Electron**: *Want to learn*
- **React Native**: *Want to learn*
- **Design Systems / Component Libraries / Grid Systems**: *Want to learn* - Again a broad set of things, but this just generally applies to me wanting to learn how to build front end systems better and all that it encompasses by build UI libraries and design systems.

- **GIT** - *Proficient*: Don't really have issues using it except for maybe some very advanced concepts.
- **VS Code** - *Profecient*: Current favourite editor
- **Netlify** - *Amateur*: Have used it for several projects, for it's CI/CD integration and usage of lambda functions.
- **UX/UI** - *Amateur*: I want to get better at general design for interfaces and user experiences. I am getting better as I work on real world production software, but only for a specific user base.
