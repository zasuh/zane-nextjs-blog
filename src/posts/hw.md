Ok so this is an obligatory Hello World post for every new blog that comes out!

In short this blog is about programming or web dev specifically.

I might even write about some of my favourite genres of music from time to time.

Not sure when I'm gonna write. Might just port some of my old Medium blogs,
over to this one now and see where things go from there! See ya around fellow
developers :)
